https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e614bb1b-65c2-42c9-8e95-31cf7cb56f6f

This project is a creative reimagining of the legendary Flappy Bird game, integrated with Artificial Intelligence for body gesture control (Pose Estimation) via Webcam. Instead of pressing keys, you "flap" your arms in real life to make the bird fly!

## ✨ Key Features
* **AI-Powered Control:** Utilizes **MediaPipe Pose** to detect wrist and shoulder positions in real-time.
* **Split-Screen Interface:** One side features the game (Pygame), while the other shows the AI camera feed for real-time gesture tracking.
* **Optimized Game Logic:** Smooth physics, accurate scoring system, and High Score persistence.
* **Immersive Interaction:** Bridges the gap between physical movement and the virtual world.

## 🕹 How to Play
1. **Setup:** Stand about 1.5m - 2m away from the Webcam so it can clearly see your head, shoulders, and arms.
2. **Flapping:** - Raise your hands to shoulder level.
   - When you **flap your wrists down below your shoulders**, the bird in the game will receive an upward lift.
3. **Goal:** Navigate through the pipes to score points. If the bird hits a pipe or falls out of bounds, the game ends.
4. **Restart:** If you get a Game Over, simply flap your arms again to start a new round.

## 🛠 System Requirements
To run the game, you need **Python 3.8+** and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame numpy
```
